Marble Lab is a level editor tool to help me quickly create levels for a mobile game I'm developing, Marble Fall (name pending :) ).  The actual game is a 3D, motion controlled puzzle app created in the Godot game engine, but creating many levels is tedious while on the go.  Marble Lab allows me to easily paint out level tiles on a simple grid and export them as JSON, which can later be imported and converted into 3D levels in my other project's importer script.
